# ENV603Proj
Final Project for ENV 603 - Data Visualization at Yale School of the Environment

Every energy project, whether renewable or thermal, needs to be studied before connecting to the grid. Each project has to wait its turn in an interconnection queue. Each Independent System Operator (grid controller) has its own interconnection queue, and as the number of renewable energy projects looking to come online has exploded, so have these queues. Projects currently sit multiple years in major interconnection queues, waiting for the grid operators to study them and provide an estimated cost of interconnection, which range into the tens of millions of dollars. As such, long and drawn-out interconnection processes result in increased uncertainty of financial returns for these projects, affecting the future of the renewable energy industry in the US. This project will aim to visualize how these queues have grown over the years, where and from what resource the change comes from, and demonstrate the potential that queue reform could have on unlocking a vast increase in the amount of renewables on the grid. 

This project examines these issues based on PJM queue data collected over several years. The graphs generated will be used in a StoryMap, and can be found here: https://arcg.is/1jGWGe
